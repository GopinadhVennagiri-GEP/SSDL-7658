	Basic detail changes
	1. New SQL table called MainTableColumnsMaster to store 486 columns.
	2. new SP for getting all main tables.
	3. new API for getting all main tables.
	4. new SP for getting main table columns based on parameters - table name, onlySelected, withPaging, page number, page size
	5. new API to getting main table columns based on parameters - table name, onlySelected, withPaging, page number, page size

3. Remove response processing of active columns Consolidation+.
4. Domain setup process will stop creating OPS_MAIN on .NET side
5. Removal of un-used active columns
6. Once testing is successful, plan for removal of redundant and un-used APIs and SPs used for retrieving main table columns to remove clutter in the code.
7. Domain setup will include new master table.
8. Check message length for response of event ID 101
9. Correlation of worklfow and rules
