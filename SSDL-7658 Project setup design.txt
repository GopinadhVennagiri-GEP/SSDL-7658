-- Design for Multi Main table in Project setup --

** UI **
1. Main screen in Project set up 
	a. Grid to display Main tables created and Action buttons (Add,edit and download).
	b. Plugin which allows user to add or edit Main tables.
2. Functionalities 
	a. All API calls which include GET,SAVE,DOWNLOAD.
	b. Sorting, Filtering on the grid.
	c. Default grouping of unselected at top and then selected ones. 
	d. Pagination.
3. Validations
	a. Validation of Main table name.
	b. Validation of unable to de-select specific GEP columns.
	c. Show some columns as selected default but allow de-selection.
	d. Validation to prevent de-selecting saved columns.
4. Challenges:
	a. Main table edit screen - Select all 
	   - Can "Select all" be used to select all columns across all page numbers?

** Backend **
*SQL*
1. New SQL table called MainTableColumnMaster to store 486 columns as mentioned in the file against the story id SSDL-7658.
2. SP for getting all main tables.
3. SP for getting columns from MainTableColumnMaster table and columns of a saved main table.
	a. Support pagination
	b. params: tableName string, onlyShowSelectedColumns boolean.
5. SP for saving a main table.

*.NET*
1. API to get columns of a saved main table along with all master columns from MainTableColumnsMaster table.
	a) API should support pagination.
2. API to save columns.
3. API to get all Main Tables saved.

Questions:
1. Should we save the GEP - Admin - Data Lake, GEP - Admin - ID, GEP - System 
	as Selected while saving new maintable. - Should be selected but excluded on the UI based on Category type and should be available on Project configuration.
2. If we store GEP - Admin - Data Lake, GEP - Admin - ID, GEP - System columns 
   as Selected  {need to connect with PMG}
   then are we suppose to show them on  
   a. Consolidation till Publish. - No
   b. Import Utility - No 
   c. Export Utility - NO
3. If these columns are not Selected but saved then are we suppose to send 
   GEP - Admin - Data Lake, GEP - Admin - ID, GEP - System columns in Project Configuration Json  - yes
