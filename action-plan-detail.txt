1. For any bug fixes to all the plugin changes, send out an email to SpendDotNet team that
always deploy spend-api along with any other plugins
otherwise code will break.
Set up a meeting with all .NET developers to make them understand.

2. Use isMultiTableEnabled() at all places where new code is being used.
Including HTML and Angular

3. Don't touch existing code, if required, take a copy of existing code and wrap it in a function
and then call this old function if isMultiTableEnabled() returns false, or new code if it's true.
